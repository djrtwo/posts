# What is this?
This repository contains my blog post drafts. If you found this, you
might get to see some raw and unedited posts. Please don't judge me too much 
if I sound crazy ðŸ˜…

I'm a big fan of radical openness, so I figure keeping my drafts in the
open could be cool. We will see!

> Thank you for living. Thank you for loving. Thank you for being you.
